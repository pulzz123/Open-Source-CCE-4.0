CCE 4  - Open Source Version
============================

.. contents::

This package is the basic open source version of CryptoCoin Explorer 4.0.

The purpose of a block chain explorer is to setup and maintain a
web application friendly database of a cryptocoin block chain.
A basic database loader and explorer web server is included.

This package is intended to be a foundation in creating a feature rich
explorer. However, it can be used as a basic explorer as-is.

The closed source production version in development is much more robust and feature rich.
In the time up to the roll out/upgrade of cryptocoinexplorer.com from 3.5 to 4.0, some features
will be added to this open source package.
